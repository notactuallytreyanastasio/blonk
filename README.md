# Blonk

## What is Blonk?
ATProto reddit.
But it will be different, thats just a thing to say to make people place a vibe in their head.

Blonk doesn't have subreddits like a forum. It has loose groups of vibes.

Maybe they will just be subscribers, but maybe a vibe isnt just users it identifies but users who label themselves into it or something.

We will need to build this in a way where it is consumable on its own website.
It should have some mechanism where it creates its own lexicon or something for the links?

I dont know, we are going to walk through this together.

## Building It
I started off with a simple TypeScript project and got cooking.

You can find that in aeb0dc780a395bf6193a8dc90bd4ab4f82f66d90.

    Initial commit with a little structure.

    We've added the ATProto SDK and set up a really basic setup.
    It's all Claude generated, but this is a learning exercise to let's take
    a look at it.

    BlonkAgent - to be renamed, but basically our Bsky client

    POST_NSID - our namespace identifier (What is this? We'll come back to that)

    PostManager - our interface to create or retrieve posts

    `index.ts` - a super basic page skeleton

    With this I guess we can try to get some shit on a page.
```

I guess now I'm just going to see what Claude has cooked up?

Once we have some shit on a screen I can think a little more.
